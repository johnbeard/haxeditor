/*
 * This is the source code for our Coverity user model file.  The
 * purpose of user models is to increase scanning accuracy by explaining
 * code Coverity can't see (out of tree libraries) or doesn't
 * sufficiently understand.  Better accuracy means both fewer false
 * positives and more true defects.  Memory leaks in particular.
 *
 * - A model file can't import any header files.  Some built-in primitives are
 *   available but not wchar_t, NULL etc.
 * - Modeling doesn't need full structs and typedefs. Rudimentary structs
 *   and similar types are sufficient.
 * - An uninitialized local variable signifies that the variable could be
 *   any value.
 *
 * The model file must be uploaded by an admin in the analysis settings of
 * the Coverity project.
